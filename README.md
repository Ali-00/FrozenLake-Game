# FrozenLake-Game
In Frozen Lake environment we teach the agent to move from one block to another and learn from the mistakes.
he Frozen Lake environment is a 4×4 grid which contain four possible areas  — Safe (S), Frozen (F), Hole (H) and Goal (G). The agent moves around the grid until it reaches the goal or the hole. If it falls into the hole, it has to start from the beginning and is rewarded the value 0. The process continues until it learns from every mistake and reaches the goal eventually.
